    <section class="section">
      <p>Pigs require consistent feeding based on their age, sex, growth stage, and other factors. Sows and boars may be fed once or twice a day, while growing pigs benefit from 24-hour access to feed. Note that pigs <span class="warning">cannot live on pasture alone</span> and must not be fed meat or kitchen scraps due to health and legal concerns.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Types of Feeds</h2>
      <button class="collapsible">Complete Feeds</button>
      <div class="content">
      
        <p>Bought from feed mills, designed to meet full nutritional needs. Best growth, higher upfront cost, simplest to manage.
          It is important to note that pigs cannot be raised on pasture alone and will require additional feed for proper growth and development. There are several things you need to consider when feeding your pigs. It is also important to know that it is illegal to feed any meat or meat products to your pigs. This is one reason not to feed table scraps.
Complete Feeds

Complete feeds are typically purchased from a feed mill and designed to meet all the nutritional requirements of your pigs. Different feeds will be required for different stages of growth, and your feed company can assist you with this. This might seem like the most expensive approach upfront, but it is also the simplest, and your pigs will have the best growth.

        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Grain-Based Homemade Feeds</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Can include grains like wheat, barley, peas, and lentils. Requires vitamin/mineral supplements. Cheaper, but slower growth. Some people will prefer to make (grind) their own feed to save on cost. These diets can consist of a single grain (e.g. wheat or barley) or multiple grains (e.g. wheat/barley/peas/ lentils) with or without by-products (distillers, screenings). These diets will require an additional vitamin/mineral supplement to ensure nutritional requirements are met. Diets tend to be cheaper than complete feeds; however, pigs will also tend to grow more slowly. Vitamin/mineral supplements can be found at your local feed mill.
Produce-Based Homemade Feeds

In some cases, produce (fruits and vegetables) may provide a low-cost opportunity in feeding your pigs. These diets will require a very specific vitamin/mineral supplement to ensure nutritional needs of the pig are met. While it is acceptable to use produce in a feeding program, you must ensure it has never entered a kitchen or has been in contact with meat or products of animal origin. Typically, supermarket or market garden leftovers would provide a viable option for sourcing these types of products. DO NOT feed food/table scraps as they can be contaminated with meat products. Feeding any product that contains meat or meat products is illegal in Canada.
